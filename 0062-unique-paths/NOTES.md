Binomial coefficient:
​
class Solution {
public:
int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
int N = n + m - 2;// how much steps we need to do
int k = m - 1; // number of steps that need to go down
double res = 1;
// here we calculate the total possible path number
// Combination(N, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!)
// reduce the numerator and denominator and get
// C = ( (n - k + 1) * (n - k + 2) * ... * n ) / k!
for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++)
res = res * (N - k + i) / i;
return (int)res;
}
};
First of all you should understand that we need to do n + m - 2 movements : m - 1 down, n - 1 right, because we start from cell (1, 1).
​
Secondly, the path it is the sequence of movements( go down / go right),
therefore we can say that two paths are different
when there is i-th (1 .. m + n - 2) movement in path1 differ i-th movement in path2.
​
So, how we can build paths.
Let's choose (n - 1) movements(number of steps to the right) from (m + n - 2),
and rest (m - 1) is (number of steps down).
​
I think now it is obvious that count of different paths are all combinations (n - 1) movements from (m + n-2).
