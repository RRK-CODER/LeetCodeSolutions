we can make it House Robber Problem  by creating 'sum' array in which sum[i] is sum of all 'i' present in array.
Eg: arr[] = {1,1,2,2,3,4,5,5,5,9}
Then sum array we created will be, sum[] = {0,2,4,3,4,15,0,0,0,9}
Here every index rep sum of 'i' in the given array. Now on this array, we can use the house robbery concepts here we can not take consecutive elements.
