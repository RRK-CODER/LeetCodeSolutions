Intuition:
If we do brute force, we have 2N horizontal possible sliding, 2N vertical sliding and N^2 to count overlap area.
We get O(N^4) solution and it may get accepted.
But we waste out time on case of sparse matrix.

​
Explanation:
Assume index in A and B is [0, N * N -1].
​
Loop on A, if value == 1, save a coordinates i / N * 100 + i % N to LA.
Loop on B, if value == 1, save a coordinates i / N * 100 + i % N to LB.
Loop on combination (i, j) of LA and LB, increase count[i - j] by 1.
If we slide to make A[i] orverlap B[j], we can get 1 point.
Loop on count and return max values.
I use a 1 key hashmap. Assume ab for row and cd for col, I make it abcd as coordinate.
For sure, hashmap with 2 keys will be better for understanding.

Complexity:
Assume A the number of points in the image A
B the number of points in the image B,
N = A.length = B.length.
O(N^2) time for preparing,
and O(AB) time for loop.
So overall O(AB + N^2) time.
Space is O(A + B).
